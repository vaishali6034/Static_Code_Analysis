# Static_Code_Analysis

Static code analysis analyze the code for its quality , quantity and reliability. It can be cost effective because we dont need to write the test cases and run the whole program.
In this i am passing the java files as an input ,basically i am giving the path of the folder where the java files are stored. The program will analyse the code and generate the output. In the output it is gonna display -
total java files
no of imports
name of the class
no of ineer classes
no of outer classes
no of function
lines of code
no of interfaces
unused variablesThe output will be different for each file . If we make some changes then the changes will count and accordingle the output will display.
It is basically finding the bugs.
I have used collection , file handling and hash map.
